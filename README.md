# Custom Page Close Opportunity

Welcome to the Custom Page Opportunity Close dialog for Dynamics 365. I always thought the OOTB dialog was extremely booring, so I decided to find a different (and more fun) way to close Opportunities in Dynamics üôè

My solution contains the following
Tables:
  - Business Unit
    - Custom Fields
      - **Teams ID** <- ID for Team to post about sales
      - **Teams Channel** ID - ID for Channel to post about sales
    - Custom Form
      - Business Unit main form <- Only to show the custom fields above
  - Opportunity
    - Commands
      - Close as Won <- Action to close the Opportunity
