# Custom Page Close Opportunity

Welcome to the Custom Page Opportunity Close dialog for Dynamics 365. I always thought the OOTB dialog was extremely booring, so I decided to find a different (and more fun) way to close Opportunities in Dynamics üôè

## Custom Page Close Dialog

My solution contains the following
Tables:
  - Business Unit
    - Custom Fields
      - **Teams ID** <- ID for Team to post about sales
      - **Teams Channel ID** <- ID for Channel to post about sales
    - Custom Form
      - **Business Unit main form** <- Only to show the custom fields above
  - Opportunity
    - Commands
      - **Close as Won** <- Button to close the Opportunity    
  - Web Resources
    - JavaScript
      - **Opportunity Button WIN** <- Javascript to opent he Custom Page    
    - Images
      - **Sales Win Icon** <- Icon for the ribbon bar
  - Pages
    - **Sales Win** <- Custom Page for closing the Opportunity
  - Processes
    - **Action - CloseOppty** <- Action for closing the Opportunity
  - Clowd Flows
    - **CloseOpptyPostTeams** <- Flow for closing the Opportunity and posting to teams
  - Apps
    - **Sales Win** <- A custom app just to display the entities needed to try out the solution
  - Connection References
    - **Microsoft Teams SalesWin** <- Connection Reference for the Teams connector
  - Site Map
    - **Sales Win** <- Ribbon for the application
  - Component Libraries
    - **SalesWin_DefaultCommandLibrary** <- No idea what this is
