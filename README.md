# Custom Page Close Opportunity

Welcome to the Custom Page Opportunity Close dialog for Dynamics 365. I always thought the OOTB dialog was extremely booring, so I decided to find a different (and more fun) way to close Opportunities in Dynamics üôè

My solution contains the following
Tables
  Business Unit
    Custom Fields
      Teams ID
      Teams Channel ID

  Opportunity
